## ðŸš€ About Echo-AI | [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/cad9f0c2bd7e4f8f8911b90ff6856592)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/FoxIDK/echo-ai/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)

Echo-AI is an AI assistant developed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the Keras library. It recognizes user input via voice or text, and generates appropriate responses using a deep learning model. The program is easily configurable and loaded with data in JSON format.

In addition to recognizing and responding to user input, Echo-AI can be hard-coded to perform specific tasks such as checking for a wellness value or responding to pre-defined messages. This means that it can be used in conjunction with smart automated programming to maintain the host system on behalf of the operator.

Echo-AI comes with pre-built generic responses and code to help kickstart your journey into AI. It is also pre-trained, making it easy to get started with minimal effort.

## âœ¨ Features

Before you ask questions, do consult the Wiki first as it goes into detail about what 'ANI' is, training the AI, etc and not reading the documentation and diving into AI can be very confusing for some, so it's worth reading up on first!

In short just run the neuralset.py before running Echo-AI.
